# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of application.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Traditional programming deals with writing a code to solve a specific problem whereas Software Engineering is extended over the entire life cycle of the software from the conception to maintenance, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to software development.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
* Project Planning it is where the team estimate the costand defines the requirement of the new software.
* Requirement gathering and Analysis here all the relevant information is collected from the customer to develop a product that as their expectation and they create a Software Requirement Specification document.
* Design here the requirement gathered in the software requirement specification document is used as an input and software architecturethat is used for implementing system development is derived.
* Implementation/ Coding it statrs when developers gets the design document and the design document is then translated into a source code.
* Testing it stsrts once the coding is complete and modules are released for testing, they test thoroughly and any defects are assigned to developers to fix them and testers refer to the software requirement specification document to make sure it is as per the customer's standard
* Deployment here it is where it is deployed in the production environment is done based on the customer expectation.
* Maintenance after the deployment of a product on the production environment maintenance of the product is done if any issuies comes up needs to be fixed or any enhancement is to be done is taken care of by the developers.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Comparison between Agile and Waterfall Models
* Agile is iterative and incremental whereas waterfall model is linear and sequential.
* In Agile customer involvement is continuous and is throughout the project whereas i Waterfall model customer involvement is limited primarily at the beginning and end.
Differences between Agile and Waterfall model
* in waterfall there is comprehensive documentation ensures that there is clarity and aids in future maintenance and In Agile model therae is less emphasis on documentation can lead to challanges in maintaining the software in long term.
preferred scenario in agile model is when we have projects with unclear requirements where in which requirements are expected to evolve.
preferred scenario in waterfall model is when there is a well defined projects where the requirements are clear, fixed and unlikely to change.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying,validating and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.
The importance of requirements engineering is that it tells everyone involved with the project what needs to be done.
The requirements engineering process
* Feasibility study
* Requirements elicitation
* Requirements specification
* Requirements for verification and validation
* Requirements management
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
It refers to the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, self contained units each of which encapsulates a specific piece of functionality.In maintainability there is isolation of changes and simplified understanding. and in Scalability there is independent development and distributed deployment
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing focuses on individual components or function within the software.
Integration testing focuses on the interaction between integrated units or modules
System testing the tests the complete integrated syatem as a whole
Acceptance testing is conducted if the system meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment
Testing is crucial in software development because it ensures that the software is high quality, meets user expectations and functions correctly and securely.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
